# SQL
## Introduction
I was tasked with designing a database for a library with the following parameters:
* specific book titles
* book inventory minimums (in total and at certain library branches)
* number of authors
* multiple branches
* number of borrowers with specific book quantities on loan
* total number of books on loan. 

In addition, I was to create stored procedures that would query for: book title found at a certain branch, [list].
